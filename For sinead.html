    Dearest Sinead ,

    How brave of you to smile even if the world you want is crumbling right before you. How brave of you to warm us with your presence even if
    your soul is turning cold. However, it pains me that your love is too vast for someone to embrace it, to feel it. But rather they contain
    your love, never giving it the chance to love.


    You can cry because you know you gave it your all. Ache because you love her. Yearn because despite the gentle warm gazes of people that surrounds you,
    your heart still cradles the quiet ache of what was once. It is okay... because to love so fiercely is to carry it's imprint, and to grieve it's absence,
    is the truth written in your soul‚Äî the profound depth of your love adorned with the lily you once gave.


    Sinead, I want you to know that it is okay to let go. It is okay to give a chance, and it is also okay to fix something that you know it can no longer be fixed, because
    that is a testament of your love. A testament of how deep and raw you love. As your heart became bruised inside a desolate garden, remember
    that you once danced in a melody of both your love. Each beat might turn into a mournful chime, i hope you know that you are not a lone
    vessel adrift on a sea of sorrow, but rather a vessel floating within a warm current of reverence, bouyed by the steadfast love of many shores.


    I love you.


    Warmly,
    izzyüß∏
